    ###  Image Captioning and Segmentation 

    This project integrates modern computer vision techniques to automatically:
    - **Generate captions** for images in multiple languages
    - **Perform both** simultaneously for a richer understanding

    ####  Tools & Techniques
    - Image Captioning: EfficientNet + CNN-LSTM
    - Image Segmentation: U-Net 
    - Multilingual Translation: Google Translate API
    - Text to speech generation for the caption
