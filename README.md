#  Image Captioning and Segmentation App

An interactive deep learning web application built using **Streamlit** that performs:
- **Image Captioning** using a CNN-LSTM architecture
- **Image Segmentation** using a UNet model  
- Includes **multilingual translation** and **audio output** of captions

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 **Automatic Image Captioning** — Describes the contents of uploaded images
- 🧠 **Semantic Segmentation** — Detects and highlights object boundaries in the image
- 🌐 **Multilingual Support** — Translate captions into multiple languages
- 🔊 **Text-to-Speech** — Hear the caption in your chosen language
- 🎨 User-friendly **Streamlit** UI for quick access and testing

- In this project chaintanya have worked on Image segmentation part.HERE THE MODELS ARE NOT BEING UPLOADED DUE TO THE LARGE SIZE OF THE FILES
